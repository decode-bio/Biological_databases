## Introducion 
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a division of the U.S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Established by Congress in 1988, NCBI’s mission is to design, develop, implement, and manage automated systems for the collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, and dissemination of knowledge in molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics, advancing science and health by providing open access to biomedical and genomic information.

## Resources & Tools
It is a comprehenshive suite of databases and software tools tht serve the global lifecience community. Below are the major resources
* GenBank
  
URL(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)

GenBank is the National Institutes of Health’s annotated genetic sequence database, housing all publicly available DNA and RNA sequences. It operates as part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) alongside DDBJ and ENA, exchanging data daily and issuing comprehensive releases every two months

-Can downlaod the desired sequence in FASTA format.

-Can get details of sequence origin.

-Can see the graphics to get visual roadmap of that sequence and its annotations.

* PubMed (Biomedical Literature)

URL(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

PubMed is an openly accessible, free online database of references and abstracts for life sciences and biomedical literature. Launched in January 1996 and maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health, it primarily houses the MEDLINE collection and integrates citations from journals, books, and other NLM records as part of the Entrez retrieval system.

-PubMed offers advanced search capabilities with automatic term mapping to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Boolean operators, and filters to refine results.

-Many PubMed records link directly to full-text articles in PubMed Central and publisher sites, making it an indispensable resource for researchers, clinicians, and students worldwide.

* Sequence Read Archive (raw sequencing data)

URL(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=)

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a publicly accessible repository of raw high-throughput sequencing data, established by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2007. It serves as a central archive for “short reads” generated by next-generation sequencing platforms and is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration alongside the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).

-SRA stores unprocessed reads and associated metadata from individual runs (SRR) up through experiments (SRX) and studies/projects (SRP) enabling reproducibility and large scale meta analysis.

-Users can search and download data via the NCBI web portal, the SRA Toolkit (fastq-dump, prefetch), FTP/Aspera transfers, or directly in cloud environments on AWS and Google Cloud.

* dbSNA(variant annotations)

URL(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)

dbSNP is a free, public‐domain archive hosted by NCBI that catalogs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions/deletions, microsatellites, and other minor genetic variants. It was initiated in 1998 through a collaboration between NCBI and NHGRI and became publicly available in 1999. Each submitted variant receives a stable submission ID (ss#), and identical records are clustered into reference SNP IDs (rs#) for non-redundant aggregation of allele frequencies, molecular consequences, genomic context, and clinical annotations.

-Variant types: SNPs, small indels, microsatellites, MNPs, structural variants.

-Accession system: ss# for individual submissions; rs# for clustered references

-Annotations: population allele/genotype frequencies, clinical significance, molecular impact

-Data integration: large-scale projects (1000 Genomes, gnomAD, ALFA, TOPMed)

-Access modes: Entrez search, E-utilities API, FTP bulk download, Variation Viewer
