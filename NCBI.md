Can downlaod the desired sequence in FASTA format
Can get details of seuence origin
Can see the graphics to get visual roadmap of that sequence and its annotations.

* PubMed (Biomedical Literature)
* Sequence Read Archive (raw sequencing data)
* dbSNA(variant annotations)
* Gene Database  (gene-centric Information)
These are all searchable via the Entrez retrieval system.
